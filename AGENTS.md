# Codex Agent Instructions

This repository contains the Jellystat frontend and backend source. Follow these guidelines when creating pull requests.

## Coding Style
- Use **two spaces** for indentation. Tabs are not used.
- Prefer **double quotes** for JavaScript/Node/React source files.

## Development Commands
- Run `npm install` if dependencies are missing.
- Run `npm run lint` from the repo root and ensure it succeeds before committing any changes.
- There are currently no automated tests, so linting is the only required check.
